# Common Workflows

A collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows to standardize CI/CD practices across repositories.

## Why?

**Don't Repeat Yourself.** Write quality automation once, reuse it everywhere.

This repository provides battle-tested workflows that handle common development tasksâ€”from validating PRs to deploying releases. Instead of copying and maintaining the same workflow logic across dozens of repositories, reference these centralized workflows and keep your CI/CD pipeline consistent and maintainable.

## Quick Start

Reference a workflow in your `.github/workflows/` directory:

```yaml
name: Validate PR Labels
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, labeled, unlabeled]

jobs:
  check-semver-label:
    uses: lowranceworks/common-workflows/.github/workflows/semver-label-check.yaml@main
    with:
      # Add any required inputs here
```

## Available Workflows

### Pull Request Workflows
Run when PRs are opened or updated to validate and notify.

- **[semver-label-check](docs/semver-label-check.md)** - Ensures PRs have semantic versioning labels (major/minor/patch)
- **[slack-pr-review](docs/slack-pr-review.md)** - Notifies your team when reviews are needed

### Post-Merge Workflows
Automatically run after code is merged to your main branch.

- **[build-zip-upload-artifactory](docs/build-zip-upload-artifactory.md)** - Builds and uploads ZIP artifacts to Artifactory
- **[create-tag-and-release](docs/create-tag-and-release.md)** - Automatically creates Git tags and GitHub releases
- **[slack-artifact-build](docs/slack-artifact-build.md)** - Sends build status notifications to Slack

### Deployment Workflows
Run after releases are created to notify about deployments.

- **[slack-deployment](docs/slack-deployment.md)** - Sends deployment notifications to Slack

## Examples

Check the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for ready-to-use workflow files organized by when they run:

- **`on-pull-request/`** - Validation and review notification workflows
- **`after-merge/`** - Build, release, and notification workflows
- **`after-release/`** - Deployment notification workflows

## Usage Tips

### Pinning Versions

For production use, pin to a specific version instead of `@main`:

```yaml
uses: lowranceworks/common-workflows/.github/workflows/semver-label-check.yaml@v1.2.3
```

### Required Secrets

Most workflows require repository secrets to be configured:

- `ARTIFACTORY_URL` and `ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN` - For artifact uploads
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - For Slack notifications
- GitHub token is automatically provided via `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`

### Permissions

Reusable workflows may need specific permissions. Always include the `permissions` block:

```yaml
jobs:
  my-job:
    uses: lowranceworks/common-workflows/.github/workflows/create-tag-and-release.yaml@main
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: read
```

## Contributing

Improvements and new workflows are welcome! Please:

1. Follow the existing structure and naming conventions
2. Add documentation in the `docs/` directory
3. Include a working example in `examples/`
4. Test thoroughly before submitting a PR
